                        about architecture as a means of engaging with the complexities of humanity and its position within the larger social paradigm – specifically
                        in the richly diverse context of South Africa.
                        I am intrigued by the concept of architecture and design that “works hard” (26’10 Architects) - Architecture that not only cultivates activity,
                        but becomes and integral participant in the day to day rituals of the South African user; establishing an oscillating relationship with the individuals whom activate the space.
