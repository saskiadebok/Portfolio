                <h1>ARCHITECTURAL MANIFESTO</h1>
                <p>An architectural intern, having recently graduated with a degree BSc Architecture obtained from the University of Pretoria. Immensely passionate
                    about architecture as a means of engaging with the complexities of humanity and its position within the larger social paradigm – specifically
                    in the richly diverse context of South Africa.
                    I am intrigued by the concept of architecture and design that “works hard” (26’10 Architects) - Architecture that not only cultivates activity,
                    but becomes and integral participant in the day to day rituals of the South African user; establishing an oscillating relationship with the individuals whom activate the space.
